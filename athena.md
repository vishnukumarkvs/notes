I have an alertmanager for customers where customers can create their own receiver and they are updated in config in alertmanager from time to time and we reload alertmanager, This is not scalabale as we have 1000's of customers and 10s of 1000;s of receivers. Alertmanager takes 2 hours to reload. How to solve this?
